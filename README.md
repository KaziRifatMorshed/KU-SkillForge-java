# KU-SkillForge-java
SkillForge is a user-friendly programming practice GUI application created with Java. It serves as an offline platform dedicated to strengthening your programming skills through engaging problem-solving exercises, empowering Learners to fortify their skills with basic to advanced exercises.


## Planned Features:
- Step by Step practice problems for basic to advanced programming topics
- After getting an exercise problem, it takes 10 min (counting screen time) to assist users with hints, but won't provide solutions. Solutions will be provided after 3/6/12/24 hours after getting question (time varies based on difficulty level)
- Keeps you motivated
- Runs Locally, totally Offline
- Keeps logs and personal data in an encrypted file
- Connects to a server to make a leaderboard among friends to grow a competitive mindset among class/batch
- includes CODEFORCES number of solves and contest participation among class
- can be used to make points achieved after solving problems in skill-forge and codeforces
- this program could be made open for all. In that case, we need private room and varification process for CSEKU students 
- Need to integrate AntiCheat to discourage LLM, AI, Copy-Paste initiatives.
